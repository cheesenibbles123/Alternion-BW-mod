# Alternion
This is a split off from my first mod

Features:
 - Custom Badges based on steamID's managed by a website
 - Custom Sail skins based on captain's steamID
 - Custom Cannon skins based on captain's steamID
 - Custom Weapon skins based on player's steamID
 
# Issues:
 - The main known issue currently is possible lag every few seconds, I believe this is tied to the leaderboard updating, as this is more noticeable on servers with more players. Best fix for this might be to cache the badges on main Start(), although depending on the future badge count this may/may not be unsustainable (will require a deeper look).
 
# Additional notes:
 - All required files will be downloaded automatically by the mod when it runs
 - I suck at this
 - Enjoy my crappy code

# YOU WILL NEED HARMONY FOR THIS
